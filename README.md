### How to start

Get the files:
* ```git clone https://github.com/akosb/calculator.git```
* or download the zip

To open the calculator, open calc/index.html in a web browser.

If nodejs is installed, it's possible to start a server that serves the same page. To do so, one have to:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Thereafter http://localhost:3000/ will serve the same page.

### Plans

Day 1: Let's talk about the internet: what is a page/server/client/browser? HTML + CSS basics: we talk about html, write the skeleton for the calculator. In addition we start with simple CSS formatting.

Day 2: Finishing the HTML + CSS, so we can continue with JavaScript, implementing the logic.

Day 3: finishing javascript ( +server if we have time)

Day 4: demo day

Extras: 
* kids can format the calculator as they wish (see style.css file for links)
* those that are fast can implement more calculator functionality (eg.: %, +/-)
* if time allows it we can make the server version better, so it can save calculations
